v1.2.1 New:
The camera tracking mode now also works with docking ports (not just Camera part as previous version).

Feature:
- Add game built-in camera part to your ship design. Camera views from that part, as well as from the landing gear, wings, and engines, pilot... will be also automatically added.
- Launch the game and toggle the PiP Overlay Button at the top of the Flight Info menu.
- From PiP's LIVE dropdown list, select a camera or click [+] to open a New camera tab.
- Use the L&R mouse to Rotate / Drag, Alt + Scroll to Move forward/backward, Scroll to zoom.
- Middle mouse to enable Target Lock (lock on GPS or follow target).
- Go to Game Settings to enable multi-display support (experiment).

Upcoming:
- Add a video/photo record button for each camera window.
- Fire at a locked target & ATGM missile.
- Split and display the Map view and Game view separately on two monitors.

Known Glitches:
- Render range is limited when in map view.
- Space camera view may not match the main camera (planets sometimes appear in the wrong position).
- FPS drop in Ultra game settings (reducing max lighting and reflections may help).
- Laser Lock on water may not be precise, and water rendering may appear slightly worse.
