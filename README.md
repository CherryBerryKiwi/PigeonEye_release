PigeonEye is a mod for the game Juno: New Origins (SimpleRockets 2) that adds overlayed PiP mini cameras, still visible even in map view!

It can display the main game camera, nearby crafts' cameras, docking ports, and engines... offering multiple action camera views with adjustable angles, rotation, pan, and zoom capabilities.

Bonus: I’ve added some tweaks in the game settings for multi-display support, so you can expand your view to ultra-wide and really soak in that overview effect.

It took me quite a few cups of coffee and a lot of trial and error, as I was completely new to programming in C# and Unity. I wasn’t so sure where to start when I first had this idea.
So, if you like this mod, consider buying me a coffee, it’ll help me add more cool features!
